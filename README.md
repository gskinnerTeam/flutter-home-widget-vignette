# flutter_home_widget_vignette

Demonstrates a basic implementation of an iOS "Home Widget" in Flutter.

This app shows a slightly augmented Counter App which has an associated HomeWidget.

It uses the `home_widget` package to communicate with the iOS Home Screen Widget and to render a
Flutter Widget off-screen which serves as the background image for the Home Widget.

For detailed instructions on how to add a Home Screen Widget to your app see the Flutter code lab:
